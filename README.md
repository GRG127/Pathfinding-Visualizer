# 🧩 Pathfinding Visualization Maze Game 🧭

This is a simple React-based project that allows users to visualize the pathfinding algorithm (Breadth-First Search, BFS) on a grid. Users can set up walls, choose a start and end point, and find the shortest path between them using BFS. The app provides an interactive way to understand how pathfinding works in grid-based scenarios.

## 🌟 Features

- **Customizable Grid**: Users can toggle walls on the grid. 🧱
- **Start and End Points**: Set your start 🚦 and end 🏁 points, and the algorithm will find a path between them.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm (BFS)**: Uses the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path. 🔍
- **Interactive Visualization**: See the grid cells change in real-time as the algorithm runs. 💡
- **Reset Option**: Reset the grid and start over with a new maze. 🔄
- **Wall Toggling**: Toggle between setting walls 🛑 or start/end points 🏁 using a button.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface. ⚛️
- **CSS**: Styling for the grid, buttons, and message display. 🎨
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the grid and pathfinding algorithm. 💻
- **HTML**: Basic structure for the app. 📝
