# Pathfinding Visualization Maze Game

This is a simple React-based project that allows users to visualize the pathfinding algorithm (Breadth-First Search, BFS) on a grid. Users can set up walls, choose a start and end point, and find the shortest path between them using BFS. The app provides an interactive way to understand how pathfinding works in grid-based scenarios.

## Features

- **Customizable Grid**: Users can toggle walls on the grid.
- **Start and End Points**: Set your start and end points, and the algorithm will find a path between them.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm (BFS)**: Uses the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path.
- **Interactive Visualization**: See the grid cells change in real-time as the algorithm runs.
- **Reset Option**: Reset the grid and start over with a new maze.
- **Wall Toggling**: Toggle between setting walls or start/end points using a button.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the grid, buttons, and message display.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the grid and pathfinding algorithm.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The algorithm used to find the shortest path through the grid, avoiding walls.
- **HTML**: Basic structure for the app.
